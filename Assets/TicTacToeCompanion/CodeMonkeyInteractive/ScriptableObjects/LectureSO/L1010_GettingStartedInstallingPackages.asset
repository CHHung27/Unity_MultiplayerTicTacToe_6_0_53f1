  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Getting Started and Installing Packages</h1><p>In
    this lecture, we set up the <strong>foundation </strong>for our Multiplayer Simple
    Tic Tac Toe Game. We started by creating a new Unity project using the <strong>Universal
    2D </strong>template (URP) and installing <strong>Netcode for GameObjects</strong>,
    Unity\u2019s networking tool. The NetworkManager component was added to manage
    multiplayer connections, and we explored the three main network topologies: Server,
    Client, and Host.</p><p>To speed up testing, we installed the <strong>Multiplayer
    Play Mode </strong>package, allowing us to simulate multiplayer connections directly
    within Unity. We also added the <strong>Multiplayer Tools </strong>package and
    used the RuntimeNetworkStatsMonitor to verify active connections. Finally, we
    imported the visual assets to prepare for the next steps. Let\u2019s keep going!</p>\n<p>Unity
