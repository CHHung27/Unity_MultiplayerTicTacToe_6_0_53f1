  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Intro to Simple Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe</h1><p>Hello
    and Welcome, I'm your Code Monkey!</p><p>Welcome to my Simple Multiplayer Tic
    Tac Toe course!</p><p>Here we\u2019ll build a straightforward multiplayer game
    from scratch, focusing on core multiplayer concepts like synchronizing data between
    players, hosting connections, and managing turns. While the game design is basic,
    it\u2019s perfect for learning the foundations you can later apply to create
    games like <strong>Among Us </strong>or Overcooked.</p><p></p><p>This course
    uses Unity\u2019s <b>Netcode for GameObjects</b>, ideal for small-scale co-op
    games. The <strong>Project Files </strong>are included for every lecture in the
    course, if you get stuck you can download those and compare them with your own.</p><p>Also
    make sure to do all the <strong>Quizzes </strong>and <strong>FAQs </strong>for
    every lecture to ensure you're really learning. The <strong>companion project
    </strong>also has a window to <strong>Chat with an AI </strong>that was trained
    on the contents of the course and a window that is constantly monitoring your
    project for <strong>possible mistakes </strong>and showcasing potential solutions.</p><p>Join
    the <strong>Private Discord </strong>and join me on the <strong>Private Livestreams
    </strong>every Saturday.</p><p>Thanks and I hope you learn a lot in this course!</p>\n<p>Learn
