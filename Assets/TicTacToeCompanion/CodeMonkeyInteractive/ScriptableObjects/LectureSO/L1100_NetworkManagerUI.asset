  lectureDescription: '<h1>Lecture Summary: NetworkManagerUI</h1><p>In this lecture,
    we created a simple NetworkManagerUI to replace the <strong>inspector buttons
    </strong>for connecting to the game. This makes starting the game much more user-friendly.</p><p>We
    added two buttons, <strong>Host </strong>and <strong>Client</strong>, inside
    a new UI object. A NetworkManagerUI script was created to manage these buttons,
    with <strong>click listeners </strong>set to call the <strong>NetworkManager.Singleton
    </strong>functions for starting as a Host or Client. Once a button is clicked,
    the UI is hidden.</p><p>After testing, the new UI works perfectly, letting us
    connect and start the game with ease without having to use the Unity Inspector.
    This is a simple but important step in improving our game''s usability!</p>
