  lectureDescription: "<h1>Lecture Summary: Grid Setup</h1><p>In this lecture, we
    set up a clickable grid for our Tic Tac Toe game. Starting with visuals, we created
    a grid using sprites and <strong>BoxCollider2D </strong>components to detect
    clicks with <strong>OnMouseDown(). </strong>Each grid position was turned into
    a prefab for easier management and named systematically (GridPosition_0_0, GridPosition_0_1,
    etc).</p><p>We wrote a GridPosition script to handle clicks using Unity's OnMouseDown
    function, ensuring the object had a 2D collider. As an alternative, we briefly
    covered using the <strong>IPointerDownHandler </strong>interface with a Physics2D
    raycaster but stuck with the simpler method.</p><p>Finally, we added <strong>X
    </strong>and <strong>Y </strong>coordinates to each grid position using <strong>private
    </strong>fields with the <strong>[SerializeField] </strong>attribute, allowing
    us to log the exact grid position clicked. With this setup, we\u2019re ready
    to move into multiplayer synchronization in the next steps!</p>\n<p>Why you should
