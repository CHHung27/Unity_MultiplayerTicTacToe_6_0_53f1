  lectureDescription: '<h1>Lecture Summary: Rematch Functionality</h1><p>In this
    lecture, we implemented a Rematch feature, allowing players to <strong>restart
    the game </strong>without restarting the entire game executable. The process
    involves resetting the game state, clearing the board by destroying visuals,
    and hiding the Game Over UI.</p><p>We added a Rematch Button to the GameOver
    UI and linked it to a Rematch function in the GameManager. The rematch logic
    was implemented as a <strong>ServerRpc </strong>to ensure the server handles
    the reset:</p><p>- <strong>Reset the board state:</strong> We cycled through
    the playerTypeArray to set all positions to PlayerType.None and reset the currentPlayerType
    to Cross.</p><p>- <strong>Clear visuals: </strong>An event was fired, and the
    GameVisualManager destroyed all visual game objects, including grid visuals and
    the winning line.</p><p>-<strong> Hide GameOverUI: </strong>The GameOverUI listened
    for a rematch event and hid itself.</p><p>To ensure synchronization, we used
    an RPC to fire the <strong>OnRematch </strong>event on both the server and clients.</p><p>Testing
    confirmed the feature works as expected: after a win, clicking the rematch button
    resets the board, visuals, and turn order for a fresh game.</p>
